This repository demonstrates a common error in Hack programming: stack overflow due to unbounded recursion. The `foo` and `bar` functions are designed to calculate factorial and the sum of numbers recursively. However, the absence of a proper termination condition in `foo` (for extremely large x values) causes it to recurse indefinitely leading to a stack overflow.  The solution shows how to add bounds checking and use iterative methods to prevent the error.
